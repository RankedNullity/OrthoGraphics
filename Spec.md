# Graphics Specs
## Interface 1: Debug and user showcase
A user-orientated interface mainly for debugging and interactive demoing. Maybe do something with a physical cube later?

### Want
- The ability to render and freely rotate parts of the rubicks cube in space. (Moving the camera would be nice)
- For a debug, also just a panel with a display of each face. 
- Only one window is fine. 
- User friendliness max



## Interface 2: Tech demo
- Ability to open multiple windows at a time
- the view consists of two (non camera-rotatable) cubes, probably directly at the corners.
- Adjustable rotation animation speed, with the ability to remove the animation entirely. 
- Compactness and performance. 
- Display only, no need for interaction and event handling.
